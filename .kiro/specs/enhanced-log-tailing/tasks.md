  - _Requirements: 1.1, 6.1_

- [x] 4. Implement navigation event detection for tailing cancellation









  - [x] 4.1 Enhance j/k key handlers







    - Add ShouldStopTailing() check before processing j/k navigation
    - Call StopTailing() if tailing is active
    - Continue with normal navigation after stopping tailing
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_

  - [x] 4.2 Enhance Ctrl+u/Ctrl+d key handlers




    - Add ShouldStopTailing() check before processing page up/down
    - Call StopTailing() if tailing is active
    - Continue with normal page navigation after stopping tailing
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement OnNewLogLines callback method
  - [ ] 5.1 Create OnNewLogLines method signature and basic structure
    - Accept vector of new line strings as parameter
    - Add error handling for empty or invalid input
    - Add early return if not tailing or no file loaded
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.4_

  - [ ] 5.2 Implement log parsing for new lines
    - Use existing LogParser to parse new line strings into LogEntry objects
    - Handle parsing errors gracefully without stopping tailing
    - Add new entries to log_entries_ vector
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement auto-scroll functionality
  - [ ] 6.1 Create AutoScrollToBottom method
    - Calculate if auto-scroll should occur (only when tailing is active)
    - Update scroll_offset_ to show latest entries
    - Update selected_entry_index_ to last entry if needed
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.1_

  - [ ] 6.2 Integrate auto-scroll with OnNewLogLines
    - Call AutoScrollToBottom() after processing new entries
    - Ensure auto-scroll only happens when auto_scroll_enabled_ is true
    - Add performance throttling to prevent excessive scrolling
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 5.2_

- [ ] 7. Integrate tailing with filter system
  - [ ] 7.1 Apply filters to new log entries
    - Call FilterEngine::ApplyFilters on new entries in OnNewLogLines
    - Update filtered_entries_ with new matching entries
    - Ensure filter changes during tailing update display correctly
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

  - [ ] 7.2 Test filter compatibility during tailing
    - Write unit tests for tailing with various filter combinations
    - Test filter changes while tailing is active
    - Verify new entries are filtered correctly
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Integrate tailing with search functionality
  - Ensure new entries are included in search results immediately
  - Test search term changes during active tailing
  - Verify search highlighting works on new entries
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement file operation compatibility
  - [ ] 9.1 Handle file reload during tailing
    - Modify ReloadLogFile() to preserve tailing state
    - Restart FileMonitor after reload if tailing was active
    - Maintain user's position and filters after reload
    - _Requirements: 4.3_

  - [ ] 9.2 Handle file rotation and errors
    - Implement error callback for FileMonitor in OnFileMonitorError
    - Display errors but keep tailing active for recovery
    - Handle file rotation by continuing to monitor new file
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Add performance optimizations
  - [ ] 10.1 Implement batched UI updates
    - Batch multiple new log lines into single UI update
    - Add timer-based update throttling to prevent UI blocking
    - Ensure updates happen within 100ms requirement
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

  - [ ] 10.2 Implement memory management for long sessions
    - Add configurable maximum entry limit (default 10,000)
    - Implement circular buffer behavior when limit exceeded
    - Clean up filtered_entries_ when base entries are pruned
    - _Requirements: 5.4_

- [ ] 11. Update UI status indicators
