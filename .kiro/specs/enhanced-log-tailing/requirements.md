# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the log tailing functionality in the Unreal Log Viewer to provide seamless real-time log monitoring with intelligent auto-scrolling behavior. The enhancement transforms the existing 'G' (go to end) command into a smart tailing mode that automatically follows new log entries while respecting user navigation preferences and maintaining full compatibility with filtering and searching capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring live Unreal Engine logs, I want to press 'G' to automatically tail the log file so that I can see new entries as they appear without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses 'G' THEN the system SHALL start tailing the current log file
2. WHEN tailing is active THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show new log entries as they arrive
3. WHEN tailing is active THEN the UI SHALL display "LIVE" status indicator
4. WHEN no file is loaded THEN pressing 'G' SHALL show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing logs, I want tailing to stop automatically when I navigate manually so that I can examine specific entries without interference from auto-scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tailing is active AND the user presses 'j' or 'k' THEN tailing SHALL be cancelled immediately
2. WHEN tailing is active AND the user presses 'Ctrl+u' or 'Ctrl+d' THEN tailing SHALL be cancelled immediately
3. WHEN tailing is cancelled THEN the UI SHALL display "STATIC" status indicator
4. WHEN tailing is cancelled THEN the user SHALL remain at their current scroll position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using filters and search, I want tailing to work seamlessly with these features so that I can monitor filtered log streams in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tailing is active AND filters are applied THEN only new entries matching the filters SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN tailing is active AND search is active THEN new entries SHALL be searchable immediately
3. WHEN filters change during tailing THEN the display SHALL update to show filtered results including new entries
4. WHEN search terms change during tailing THEN new entries SHALL be included in search results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tailing functionality to handle file operations gracefully so that my monitoring session isn't disrupted by common file events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tailing is active AND the file is rotated THEN tailing SHALL continue with the new file
2. WHEN tailing is active AND the file becomes temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an error but continue attempting to monitor
3. WHEN tailing is active AND the file is reloaded (via 'r') THEN tailing SHALL continue after reload
4. WHEN tailing encounters errors THEN the error SHALL be displayed but tailing SHALL remain active

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tailing to provide immediate feedback and maintain performance so that real-time monitoring doesn't impact my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new log entries arrive THEN they SHALL be displayed within 100ms
2. WHEN tailing is active THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI performance
3. WHEN large bursts of log entries arrive THEN the system SHALL handle them without blocking the UI
4. WHEN memory usage grows during long tailing sessions THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tailing behavior to be intuitive and consistent so that I can rely on predictable behavior during debugging sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tailing is active THEN pressing 'G' again SHALL have no additional effect
2. WHEN tailing is active THEN all other navigation commands except j/k/Ctrl+u/Ctrl+d SHALL continue to work normally
3. WHEN the application starts THEN tailing SHALL be inactive by default
4. WHEN a new file is loaded THEN any previous tailing state SHALL be reset
