# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing vim-like visual selection mode in the Unreal Log Viewer. The feature will allow users to select multiple log lines using familiar vim-style keyboard shortcuts, enabling efficient copying of log sections for analysis and sharing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Selection Mode Activation

**User Story:** As a user familiar with vim, I want to press 'v' to enter visual selection mode, so that I can select multiple log lines using keyboard navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses 'v' in normal log viewing mode THEN the system SHALL enter visual selection mode
2. WHEN entering visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL highlight the current log line as the selection start point
3. WHEN in visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the mode is active
4. WHEN in visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL prevent normal navigation commands from affecting the view scroll position

### Requirement 2: Visual Selection Navigation

**User Story:** As a user in visual selection mode, I want to use standard navigation keys to extend my selection, so that I can select the exact range of log lines I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'j' THEN the system SHALL extend the selection down by one line
2. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'k' THEN the system SHALL extend the selection up by one line
3. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'Ctrl+d' THEN the system SHALL extend the selection down by half a screen
4. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'Ctrl+u' THEN the system SHALL extend the selection up by half a screen
5. WHEN extending selection THEN the system SHALL visually highlight all selected lines with a distinct background color
6. WHEN extending selection beyond visible area THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to keep the selection endpoint visible

### Requirement 3: Copy Selected Lines

**User Story:** As a user with selected log lines, I want to press 'y' to copy the selection to clipboard, so that I can paste the log content into other applications for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'y' THEN the system SHALL copy all selected log lines to the system clipboard
2. WHEN copying selected lines THEN the system SHALL preserve the original raw log format for each line
3. WHEN copying multiple lines THEN the system SHALL separate each line with appropriate line breaks
4. WHEN copy operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message in the status bar
5. WHEN copy operation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message in the status bar
6. WHEN copying is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically exit visual selection mode

### Requirement 4: Visual Selection Mode Exit

**User Story:** As a user in visual selection mode, I want to press 'ESC' to exit the mode without copying, so that I can cancel the selection if I change my mind.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in visual selection mode and the user presses 'ESC' THEN the system SHALL exit visual selection mode
2. WHEN exiting visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL clear all visual selection highlighting
3. WHEN exiting visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL return to normal log viewing mode
4. WHEN exiting visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL restore normal navigation behavior
5. WHEN exiting visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL maintain the current cursor position

### Requirement 5: Visual Selection Feedback

**User Story:** As a user working with visual selection, I want clear visual feedback about my current selection, so that I can see exactly which lines will be copied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lines are selected THEN the system SHALL highlight selected lines with a distinct background color different from the normal selection
2. WHEN in visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL display the selection range in the status bar (e.g., "VISUAL: 5 lines selected")
3. WHEN extending selection THEN the system SHALL update the visual highlighting in real-time
4. WHEN selection spans multiple screens THEN the system SHALL indicate the total selection size in the status bar
5. WHEN visual selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL display "VISUAL" mode indicator in the status bar

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Features

**User Story:** As a user of the log viewer, I want visual selection mode to work seamlessly with existing features, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL disable conflicting keyboard shortcuts temporarily
2. WHEN visual selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL still allow help dialog access via 'h' or '?'
3. WHEN visual selection mode is active THEN the system SHALL prevent filter panel toggle and search activation
4. WHEN exiting visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL restore all normal keyboard shortcuts
5. WHEN in visual selection mode THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing line number display and detail view features
