# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement Enhanced Unreal Project Detection





  - Add new utility function to process folder arguments with automatic Saved/Logs detection
  - Update main.cpp to use the enhanced folder processing logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 1.1 Add ProcessFolderArgument utility function


  - Create new function in unreal_project_utils.h/cpp that checks for Saved/Logs subfolder
  - Function should return resolved path and status message for user feedback
  - Include comprehensive error handling for filesystem operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 1.2 Update main.cpp folder argument processing


  - Modify the command line argument handling to use ProcessFolderArgument function
  - Update user feedback messages to indicate when Saved/Logs is auto-detected
  - Ensure fallback behavior when Saved/Logs is not found
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 1.3 Add unit tests for enhanced folder detection


  - Create test cases for ProcessFolderArgument with various folder structures
  - Test scenarios: folder with Saved/Logs, folder without, invalid paths
  - Verify correct path resolution and error messages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Implement Three-State Filter System
  - Add FilterState enum and update Filter class to support include/exclude/disabled states
  - Update filter engine logic to handle exclude filters properly
  - Modify filter panel UI to display and cycle through three states
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10_

- [ ] 2.1 Add FilterState enum and update Filter class
  - Define FilterState enum with INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, DISABLED values
  - Replace is_active boolean with filter_state member in Filter class
  - Implement GetFilterState, SetFilterState, and CycleFilterState methods
  - Add backward compatibility methods for existing is_active API
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 2.2 Update filter matching logic for exclude functionality
  - Modify Filter::Matches method to handle exclude state properly
  - Add ShouldInclude and ShouldExclude helper methods
  - Update filter validation to work with new state system
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [ ] 2.3 Update FilterEngine to apply exclude filters
  - Modify ApplyFilters method to handle both include and exclude filters
  - Update PassesFilters logic to properly combine include/exclude conditions
  - Ensure disabled filters are completely ignored in filtering logic
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_

- [ ] 2.4 Update FilterPanel UI for three-state display
  - Modify RenderFilterItem to show appropriate visual indicators for each state
  - Implement green checkmark for INCLUDE, red negative sign for EXCLUDE, greyed out for DISABLED
  - Update ToggleSelectedFilter to cycle through all three states
  - Add hover tooltips explaining current state and next action
  - _Requirements: 2.9, 2.10_

- [ ] 2.5 Update filter serialization for backward compatibility
  - Modify Filter::ToJson to serialize FilterState enum
  - Update Filter::FromJson to handle both old boolean and new enum formats
  - Ensure existing filter configurations continue to work
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 2.6 Add comprehensive unit tests for three-state filters
  - Test FilterState enum cycling and state transitions
  - Test filter matching logic with include/exclude/disabled states
  - Test backward compatibility with existing boolean API
  - Test serialization and deserialization of filter states
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7_

- [ ] 2.7 Add integration tests for filter UI interactions
  - Test filter panel state cycling through user interactions
  - Verify visual indicators match filter states correctly
  - Test filter combinations with mixed include/exclude states
  - Test that filtering results are correct with exclude filters
  - _Requirements: 2.8, 2.9, 2.10_

- [ ] 3. Integration and final testing
  - Verify both improvements work together without conflicts
  - Test complete user workflows with enhanced folder detection and three-state filters
  - Update any documentation or help text to reflect new functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.10_

- [ ] 3.1 End-to-end integration testing
  - Test launching with Unreal project folders and using three-state filters
  - Verify user feedback messages are clear and helpful
  - Test edge cases like empty folders, permission issues, and invalid filter states
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.10_

- [ ] 3.2 Update help text and user documentation
  - Update any in-application help text to mention three-state filters
  - Ensure command line help reflects enhanced folder detection behavior
  - Add tooltips and status messages for new functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.10_
