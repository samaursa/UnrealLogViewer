4. WHEN combining multiple filters THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logical operations between filters and subfilters
5. WHEN closing the application THEN the system SHALL save filter configurations and restore them on next startup
6. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL show only log entries that match the filter criteria

### Requirement 4: Visual Highlighting and Color Coding

**User Story:** As an Unreal Engine developer, I want filtered log entries to be visually highlighted with distinct colors, so that I can quickly identify different types of log entries and their filter associations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primary filter is active THEN the system SHALL assign a unique highlight color to matching log entries
2. WHEN subfilters are active THEN the system SHALL use color variations (brightness/saturation) of the parent filter color
3. WHEN running on different terminals THEN the system SHALL support multiple color schemes based on terminal capabilities
4. WHEN users want customization THEN the system SHALL allow modification of highlight colors
5. WHEN filters are toggled THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators for active/inactive filter states

### Requirement 5: Filter Management Interface

**User Story:** As an Unreal Engine developer, I want an intuitive interface to manage my filters and see their effectiveness, so that I can efficiently organize and optimize my log analysis workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing filters THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated filter panel that can be toggled on/off
2. WHEN viewing filters THEN the system SHALL display them in a hierarchical tree view showing the relationship between primary filters and subfilters
3. WHEN interacting with filters THEN the system SHALL provide individual toggle controls for each filter and subfilter
4. WHEN editing filters THEN the system SHALL support in-place editing of filter criteria
5. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL display match counts and statistics for each filter
6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL support Tab to switch between panels, Enter to select filters, and Space to toggle filters on/off

### Requirement 6: Performance and File Handling

**User Story:** As an Unreal Engine developer, I want to analyze large log files (1GB+) without performance degradation, so that I can work with production-scale logs efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading large log files THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling to maintain responsive performance
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading to load log entries on demand
3. WHEN using regex filters THEN the system SHALL compile and cache regex patterns for optimal performance
4. WHEN monitoring files THEN the system SHALL perform file watching in background threads
5. WHEN running extended sessions THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN handling locked files THEN the system SHALL read from files currently being written by other processes
7. WHEN encountering different encodings THEN the system SHALL detect and handle UTF-8, UTF-16, and other common encodings

### Requirement 7: Navigation and Search

**User Story:** As an Unreal Engine developer, I want efficient navigation and search capabilities, so that I can quickly locate specific log entries and move through large log files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL support arrow keys for line-by-line movement and Page Up/Down for bulk scrolling
2. WHEN jumping to locations THEN the system SHALL support Home/End keys to jump to start/end of logs
3. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL provide quick search functionality with real-time highlighting of matches
4. WHEN navigating to specific locations THEN the system SHALL support direct navigation to line numbers or timestamps
5. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL provide Escape to cancel operations and context-sensitive help

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Persistence

**User Story:** As an Unreal Engine developer, I want my preferences and filter configurations to persist between sessions, so that I can maintain consistent workflows across development sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing the application THEN the system SHALL save user preferences including key bindings, color schemes, and layout preferences
