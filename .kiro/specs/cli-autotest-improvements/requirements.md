# CLI and Autotest Improvements Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to improve the command line interface and autotest functionality for the Unreal Log Viewer. The current autotest implementation has a fundamental flaw where it tries to test UI functionality without actually running the UI event loop, making the tests ineffective. We need to redesign the autotest system to work properly in a headless environment and improve the overall CLI experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Headless Autotest Mode

**User Story:** As a developer or CI system, I want to run automated tests of the log viewer functionality without requiring a terminal UI, so that I can verify the application works correctly in automated environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running with `--autotest` flag THEN the system SHALL perform all tests without starting the FTXUI event loop
2. WHEN running autotest THEN the system SHALL test core functionality including file loading, parsing, filtering, and navigation logic
3. WHEN autotest completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report showing test results
4. WHEN autotest encounters an error THEN the system SHALL exit with non-zero status code and include error details in the report

### Requirement 2: Non-UI Core Functionality Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the autotest to verify that the core log processing functionality works correctly without UI dependencies, so that I can ensure the business logic is sound.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing file loading THEN the system SHALL verify log entries are parsed correctly
2. WHEN testing filtering THEN the system SHALL apply filters programmatically and verify results
3. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL test logical navigation without UI rendering
4. WHEN testing search THEN the system SHALL verify search functionality works on loaded entries
5. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL verify all backend components are initialized properly

### Requirement 3: Improved CLI Help and Usage

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and comprehensive help information when using command line arguments, so that I can understand all available options and their usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running with `--help` THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage information
2. WHEN running with invalid arguments THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages and usage hints
3. WHEN running with `--version` THEN the system SHALL display version information and exit cleanly
4. WHEN providing a log file path THEN the system SHALL validate the file exists before proceeding

### Requirement 4: Autotest Report Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed autotest reports that provide actionable information about test results, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autotest runs THEN the report SHALL include timestamp, system information, and test environment details
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the report SHALL show detailed success metrics and performance data
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the report SHALL include specific error messages, stack traces, and debugging information
4. WHEN autotest completes THEN the report SHALL include a summary with pass/fail counts and overall status

### Requirement 5: CI/CD Integration Support

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the autotest functionality to integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines, so that I can automate testing of the log viewer in build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autotest succeeds THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0
2. WHEN autotest fails THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 1
3. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL output progress information to stdout for CI monitoring
4. WHEN autotest generates reports THEN the system SHALL support custom output file paths for CI artifact collection

### Requirement 6: Headless Backend Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the core backend functionality without any UI dependencies, so that I can verify the log processing engine works correctly in server environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running autotest THEN the system SHALL create a headless MainWindow instance that doesn't require FTXUI
2. WHEN testing navigation THEN the system SHALL test logical position tracking without UI rendering
3. WHEN testing filtering THEN the system SHALL verify filter engine functionality without UI components
4. WHEN testing file operations THEN the system SHALL verify file loading, parsing, and monitoring without UI feedback

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the autotest to cover all major functionality areas, so that I can be confident the application works correctly across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL test file loading with various log formats
2. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL test all filter types and combinations
3. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL test navigation boundaries and edge cases
4. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL test error handling and recovery scenarios
5. WHEN autotest runs THEN the system SHALL test performance with large log files (if provided)

### Requirement 8: Interactive Mode Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the normal interactive mode to continue working exactly as before, so that the autotest improvements don't break the existing user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running without `--autotest` flag THEN the system SHALL start in normal interactive UI mode
2. WHEN providing a log file without autotest THEN the system SHALL load the file and start the UI
3. WHEN running interactively THEN all existing keyboard shortcuts and UI functionality SHALL work unchanged
4. WHEN exiting interactive mode THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and exit gracefully
