# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the visual quality of life (QoL) aspects of the Unreal Log Viewer. The improvements focus on better visual formatting, enhanced readability, improved column spacing, relative line numbering for navigation, and making warnings/errors more prominent to create a more pleasant and efficient user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Visual Formatting and Column Spacing

**User Story:** As a user viewing log entries, I want properly spaced and formatted columns with clear visual separation, so that I can easily read and parse log information without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log entries are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide adequate spacing between columns to prevent visual merging
2. WHEN displaying timestamps and line numbers THEN the system SHALL ensure clear visual separation between these elements
3. WHEN column headers are shown THEN they SHALL be properly aligned and easy to distinguish from data rows
4. WHEN text justification is applied THEN it SHALL not make titles or content harder to parse
5. WHEN the log table is rendered THEN column boundaries SHALL be visually clear and consistent

### Requirement 2: Vim-Style Relative Line Numbers and Absolute Line Display

**User Story:** As a user navigating through log entries, I want vim-style relative line numbers in the main log view and absolute line numbers in appropriate locations, so that I can quickly navigate entries and know my exact position when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN line numbers are enabled in the main log view THEN the system SHALL display only relative line numbers in vim style
2. WHEN lines above the current selection are displayed THEN they SHALL show negative relative numbers
3. WHEN lines below the current selection are displayed THEN they SHALL show positive relative numbers
4. WHEN the user types a number followed by 'j' THEN the system SHALL jump down that many lines
5. WHEN the user types a number followed by 'k' THEN the system SHALL jump up that many lines
6. WHEN implementing line jumping THEN the system SHALL require a modifier key like Shift to activate the filtering mode
7. WHEN absolute line numbers are needed THEN they SHALL be displayed in the detail view and/or status bar
8. WHEN the current entry is selected THEN the absolute line number SHALL be shown in the status bar or detail view

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Visual Hierarchy and Color Coding

**User Story:** As a user scanning through log entries, I want warnings and errors to visually "pop" and different log elements to have appropriate visual emphasis, so that I can quickly identify important information and navigate the logs more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error log entries are displayed THEN they SHALL have prominent visual styling that makes them immediately noticeable
2. WHEN warning log entries are displayed THEN they SHALL have distinct visual styling that differentiates them from normal entries
3. WHEN normal log entries are displayed THEN they SHALL have subtle but readable styling that doesn't compete with warnings/errors
4. WHEN different log levels are shown THEN each level SHALL have appropriate color coding or visual treatment
5. WHEN extended context is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinguishable from the main log content
6. WHEN the log display uses color THEN it SHALL maintain good contrast and accessibility standards
7. WHEN syntax highlighting is applied THEN it SHALL enhance readability without being overwhelming

### Requirement 4: Logger Category Badge System

**User Story:** As a user viewing log entries from different loggers/categories, I want each logger to be displayed as a colored badge with its own distinct color, so that I can quickly identify and visually group log entries by their source category.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log entries are displayed THEN each logger/category SHALL be rendered as a visual badge
2. WHEN a logger badge is shown THEN it SHALL have its own distinct color that remains consistent across all entries from that logger
3. WHEN multiple loggers are present THEN each SHALL have a visually distinguishable color from the others
4. WHEN logger badges are rendered THEN they SHALL be compact and not take excessive horizontal space
5. WHEN the same logger appears multiple times THEN it SHALL always use the same color for consistency
6. WHEN logger colors are assigned THEN they SHALL provide good contrast against the background for readability
7. WHEN many different loggers are present THEN the color assignment system SHALL handle a reasonable number of distinct colors
8. WHEN logger badges are displayed THEN they SHALL enhance readability without overwhelming the log content

### Requirement 5: Improved Filter Interface Clarity

**User Story:** As a user working with filters, I want clear and intuitive filter interface elements with helpful descriptions, so that I understand what each filter action will do before I activate it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the filter area displays "[Enter] Expand" THEN it SHALL be replaced with a clear description of what the expand action does
2. WHEN filter options are presented THEN they SHALL have descriptive labels that explain their function
3. WHEN hovering over filter controls THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltips explaining the action
4. WHEN filter states are active THEN they SHALL be clearly indicated with appropriate visual feedback
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL clearly show the relationship between them

### Requirement 6: Overall Visual Polish and Consistency

**User Story:** As a user of the log viewer application, I want a visually polished and consistent interface that reduces eye strain and improves productivity, so that I can work with logs for extended periods comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is displayed THEN all UI elements SHALL follow consistent visual design principles
2. WHEN text is rendered THEN it SHALL use appropriate font sizes and weights for optimal readability
3. WHEN the interface uses colors THEN they SHALL be chosen to reduce eye strain during extended use
4. WHEN visual elements are interactive THEN they SHALL provide appropriate hover and focus states
5. WHEN the layout is rendered THEN it SHALL make efficient use of screen space while maintaining readability
6. WHEN the application theme is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent across all interface elements
