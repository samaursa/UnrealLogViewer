# Detail View Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### ✅ **Problem 1: Log view not taking majority of screen when detail view focused**

**Issue**: The log table was using `flex` sizing, which competed with the detail view for space, causing poor space distribution.

**Solution**: Implemented proper proportional sizing with calculated heights:

```cpp
// Before: Competing flex layouts
main_elements.push_back(RenderLogTable() | flex);
main_elements.push_back(RenderDetailView() | size(HEIGHT, EQUAL, detail_height));

// After: Calculated proportional sizing
int content_height = available_height - status_bar_height;
int detail_height = detail_view_focused_ ? 
                   std::max(15, (content_height * 2) / 3) :  // 2/3 of screen when focused
                   5;                                        // 5 lines when not focused
int log_height = content_height - detail_height - 1; // Remaining space for log table

main_elements.push_back(RenderLogTable() | size(HEIGHT, EQUAL, log_height));
main_elements.push_back(RenderDetailView() | size(HEIGHT, EQUAL, detail_height));
```

**Result**: 
- **Unfocused**: Log table gets ~25 lines, detail view gets 5 lines
- **Focused**: Log table gets ~10 lines, detail view gets ~20 lines (2/3 of screen)

### ✅ **Problem 2: Detail view should expand more**

**Issue**: Detail view was only expanding to half screen height, which wasn't enough for comfortable multi-line viewing.

**Solution**: Changed detail view to use 2/3 of available screen space when focused:

```cpp
// Before: Half screen (50%)
int detail_height = detail_view_focused_ ? std::max(15, available_height / 2) : 5;

// After: Two-thirds screen (67%)
int detail_height = detail_view_focused_ ? 
                   std::max(15, (content_height * 2) / 3) :  // 2/3 of screen
                   5;                                        // 5 lines when not focused
```

**Result**: Detail view now takes up significantly more space when focused, providing better readability for multi-line content.

### ✅ **Problem 3: Navigation not working on detail view when focused**

**Issue**: Vim-style navigation was intercepting 'j' and 'k' keys before they could reach the detail view navigation handler.

**Root Cause**: The event handling order was:
1. Vim navigation handler (intercepted j/k)
2. Regular navigation handler (never reached)

**Solution**: Modified vim navigation to respect detail view focus:

```cpp
// In HandleVimStyleNavigation method
if (ch == 'j' || ch == 'k') {
    // If detail view is focused, let it handle navigation instead of vim navigation
    if (detail_view_focused_) {
        // Don't handle vim navigation when detail view is focused
        // Let the regular navigation handler take care of it
        ClearVimCommandBuffer();
        return false;  // Let regular navigation handler process j/k
    }
    
    // ... existing vim navigation logic
}
```

**Result**: When detail view is focused, j/k keys are handled by detail view navigation instead of vim navigation.

## Updated Behavior

### **TAB Focus Cycling**:
1. **Main Window** → **Filter Panel** (if visible) → **Detail View** → **Main Window**

### **Detail View Sizing**:
- **Unfocused**: 5 lines (compact)
- **Focused**: 2/3 of screen height (minimum 15 lines)

### **Navigation Priority** (when detail view is focused):
- **j/k**: Scroll detail view content up/down
- **Page Up/Down**: Page through detail view content
- **Ctrl+U/D**: Half-page scroll in detail view
- **Home/End**: Jump to top/bottom of detail view content
- **ESC**: Unfocus detail view

### **Space Distribution** (30-line terminal example):
- **Status bars**: 2 lines
- **Available content**: 28 lines

**Unfocused detail view**:
- **Log table**: 22 lines
- **Detail view**: 5 lines
- **Separator**: 1 line

**Focused detail view**:
- **Log table**: 9 lines  
- **Detail view**: 18 lines (2/3 of 28 = ~19, minus borders)
- **Separator**: 1 line

## Testing Results

### **Detail View Focus Tests**: ✅ 13 assertions passing
- Focus state management
- Multi-line content display
- Navigation methods
- Rendering in both states

### **Multi-line Parsing Tests**: ✅ 25 assertions passing
- Multi-line grouping functionality
- Integration with detail view

### **Combined Tests**: ✅ 38 assertions passing
- All functionality working together

## User Experience Improvements

### **Before Fixes**:
- ❌ Detail view disappeared when focused
- ❌ Poor space distribution between log table and detail view
- ❌ Navigation keys didn't work in focused detail view
- ❌ Detail view too small for comfortable multi-line reading

### **After Fixes**:
- ✅ Detail view expands to 2/3 of screen when focused
- ✅ Log table maintains reasonable size (1/3 of screen when detail focused)
- ✅ All navigation keys work correctly in focused detail view
- ✅ Smooth focus transitions with clear visual indicators
- ✅ Optimal space usage for both log browsing and detail viewing

## Example Multi-line Content Viewing

### **Breadcrumb Log Entry**:
```
[2024.09.30-14.56.10:293][ 12]LogD3D12RHI: Error: [GPUBreadCrumb] 3D Queue 0
Breadcrumbs: > Frame 18010 [Active]
Breadcrumbs: | BufferPoolCopyOps [Finished]
... (45 more breadcrumb lines)
```

### **Focused Detail View** (18+ lines visible):
```
Detail View - Line 123 (Structured) [FOCUSED - j/k to scroll, ESC to unfocus]
[GPUBreadCrumb] 3D Queue 0

```

**Navigation**: j/k keys now scroll through the breadcrumb content, allowing full exploration of the multi-line log entry.

## Conclusion

All three issues have been completely resolved:

1. ✅ **Proper space distribution**: Log table and detail view now share screen space appropriately
2. ✅ **Adequate detail view size**: 2/3 of screen provides comfortable multi-line viewing
3. ✅ **Working navigation**: j/k and all navigation keys work correctly in focused detail view

The enhanced detail view now provides an excellent user experience for viewing and navigating complex multi-line log entries like GPU breadcrumbs.
