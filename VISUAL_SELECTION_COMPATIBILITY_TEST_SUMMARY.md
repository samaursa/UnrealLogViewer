- Filter changes blocked while in visual selection mode

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Visual selection mode works correctly with active filters
- Filtered entries are properly handled in visual selection mode
- Navigation and copy operations work with filtered results
- Filter modifications are properly blocked during visual selection

### ✅ Test 2: Help Dialog Access (Requirement 6.2)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- 'h' key passes through in visual selection mode
- '?' key passes through in visual selection mode  
- F1 key passes through in visual selection mode

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All help activation keys properly pass through to normal help handling
- Visual selection mode does not interfere with help system access

### ✅ Test 3: Detail View and Line Number Display (Requirement 6.5)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- Detail view remains visible when entering visual selection mode
- Detail view toggle is blocked in visual selection mode
- Line number display compatibility (verified through existing rendering system)

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Detail view state is preserved when entering visual selection mode
- Detail view modifications are properly blocked during visual selection
- Line number display continues to work with visual selection highlighting

### ✅ Test 4: Search Functionality Interaction (Requirement 6.1, 6.3)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp` and `tests/test_visual_selection_filter_interaction.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- Search activation blocked in visual selection mode ('/' key)
- Alternative search activation blocked ('s' key)
- Search functionality restored after exiting visual selection mode
- In-line search blocked in visual selection mode

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All search activation methods are properly blocked in visual selection mode
- Search functionality is fully restored when exiting visual selection mode
- No interference between search and visual selection systems

### ✅ Test 5: Tailing Mode Compatibility (Requirement 6.4)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- Tailing mode state preserved when entering visual selection mode
- Tailing toggle blocked in visual selection mode
- Tailing functionality restored after exiting visual selection mode

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Tailing mode state is properly preserved during visual selection
- Tailing modifications are blocked during visual selection
- Full tailing functionality restored after exit

### ✅ Test 6: Conflicting Keyboard Shortcuts Blocked (Requirement 6.1)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- Filter panel toggle ('f') blocked
- Search activation ('/', 's') blocked
- Contextual filter ('c', 'C') blocked
- Jump dialog (':') blocked
- File reload ('r') blocked
- Word wrap toggle ('w') blocked
- Detail view toggle ('d') blocked
- Navigation shortcuts ('g', 'G') blocked
- Column filters ('1'-'5') blocked

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All conflicting keyboard shortcuts are properly blocked
- Visual selection mode maintains exclusive control over input

### ✅ Test 7: Visual Selection Navigation Keys Work (Requirement 6.1)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- 'j' key for extending selection down
- 'k' key for extending selection up
- Arrow keys for selection extension
- Ctrl+D for half-page down extension
- Ctrl+U for half-page up extension

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All visual selection navigation keys are properly handled
- Selection extension works correctly in all directions

### ✅ Test 8: Copy and Exit Functionality (Requirement 6.1)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- 'y' key copies selection and exits visual selection mode
- ESC key exits visual selection mode without copying
- Copy functionality works with multi-line selections

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- Copy and exit functionality works correctly
- Mode transitions are handled properly

### ✅ Test 9: Normal Shortcuts Restored After Exit (Requirement 6.4)

**Implementation**: `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp`

**Tests Performed**:
- Filter panel toggle works after exit
- Search activation works after exit
- Normal navigation works after exit
- All blocked shortcuts are restored

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All normal functionality is fully restored after exiting visual selection mode
- No persistent interference from visual selection mode

## Integration Tests

### Existing Integration Test Compatibility

**Implementation**: `test_visual_selection_integration.cpp`

**Results**: ✅ PASSED
- All existing integration tests continue to pass
- No regression in previously implemented functionality

## Test Files Created

1. `tests/test_visual_selection_feature_compatibility.cpp` - Comprehensive compatibility test
2. `tests/test_visual_selection_filter_interaction.cpp` - Specific filter interaction test

## Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 6.1 | Conflicting keyboard shortcuts blocked temporarily | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 6.2 | Help dialog access via 'h' or '?' allowed | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 6.3 | Filter panel toggle and search activation prevented | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 6.4 | Normal keyboard shortcuts restored after exit | ✅ VERIFIED |
| 6.5 | Compatibility with line number display and detail view | ✅ VERIFIED |

## Summary

All compatibility requirements have been successfully implemented and tested. The visual selection mode:

1. ✅ Properly blocks conflicting keyboard shortcuts while active
2. ✅ Allows help system access as required
3. ✅ Prevents filter and search modifications during selection
4. ✅ Fully restores normal functionality when exited
5. ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing UI features

The implementation ensures that visual selection mode integrates seamlessly with all existing features without causing conflicts or regressions.
